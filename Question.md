1.  In Auto Layout, the attributes define a feature that can be constrained. In general, this includes the four edges (leading, trailing, top, and bottom), as well as the height, width, and vertical and horizontal centers. Text items also have one or more baseline attributes.

2. Most constraints define a relationship between two items in our user interface. These items can represent either views or layout guides. Constraints can also define the relationship between two different attributes of a single item, for example, setting an aspect ratio between an item’s height and width. You can also assign constant values to an item’s height or width.
